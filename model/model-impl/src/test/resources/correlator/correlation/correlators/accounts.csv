#
# The file contains some data columns plus some auxiliary ones:
#
# - The `uid` has to be a pure integer. The accounts are processed in the order of their `uid`.
# - The `test` column describes the expected result of the correlation:
#   - `_none` means that no matching
#   - `_uncertain` means that the correlator couldn't decide (If ":case" then a case should be created.)
#   - a name is a name of a specific user
#
# The automated tests processes these accounts and check if the correlator or matcher acts accordingly.

# The emp* correlators use employeeNumber and (some of them) familyName.
#
# - emp: Correlates solely on the basis of employeeNumber. Requests manual action if it cannot decide.
# - emp-fn: Correlates solely on the basis of employeeNumber and familyName.
# - emp-fn-opt: Correlates solely on the basis of employeeNumber and familyName (except for single candidate).
